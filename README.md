Hi fellow Earth Dwellers 👽🌍
Welcome to my digital galaxy of data, code, and intelligent machines 👋  

I'm **Rima Modak**, a Data Analytics Engineer with experience building intelligent, cloud-native, GenAI-powered data systems across telecom, insurance, and financial domains. I blend data engineering, machine learning, and Generative AI to build impactful analytics and automation solutions using tools like Databricks, Azure, Hugging Face, and LangChain.

🎯 I'm currently open to discussions and opportunities in Data Engineering, ML Engineering, and GenAI Systems roles — especially where LLMs, RAG pipelines, or real-time data architectures are core to the role.
